# Joint End-to-End Training Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the joint end-to-end training implementation that replaces the original two-stage training approach in the LDAGM project. The new approach combines VGAE (Variational Graph Autoencoder) and LDAGM models for simultaneous graph representation learning and link prediction.

## Key Changes from Two-Stage to Joint Training

### Original Two-Stage Approach
1. **Stage 1**: Train VGAE model to learn node embeddings
2. **Stage 2**: Use pre-trained embeddings to train LDAGM for link prediction

### New Joint End-to-End Approach
1. **Single Stage**: Train both VGAE and LDAGM simultaneously with a unified loss function
2. **Benefits**: 
   - Better gradient flow between components
   - Optimized representations for the downstream task
   - Reduced training complexity
   - Potential for better performance
